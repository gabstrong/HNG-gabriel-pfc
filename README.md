#### STAGE 1️⃣
#🌐 Multi-Page Profile Website — HNG Internship (Stage 1)

This project is a continuation of my *HNG Internship Stage 0* task.  
In Stage 0, I built a single responsive Profile Card using semantic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
In Stage 1, I extended it into a small *multi-page website* with two new pages:  
an *About Me* page and a *Contact Us* page (with form validation).
